                of inspection equipment. They also say it is easy to from afar with a intuitive tablet app and built in stereo cameras. They also say you can program repeatable
                autonomous missions to gather consistent data. It also has 360 degree perception it can use to map the terrain and avoid obstacles as they appear.
                It has the ability to balance dynamically in uncertain surroundings with a payload up to 14kg(about 30 pounds). Its also capable of moving over almost all terrain.

            <h4><u>Rats with Backpacks</u></h4>
            <p>A student at the Dutch Technical University of Eindhoven, demonstrated how rats can sniff out buried victims. The rats are aided by high-tech backpacks that gives the rats a communication link back to the human handler.
              All this is done in association with Belgian-registered and Tanzania-based NGO APOPO, their achievements include training gold medal winning Magawa the rat, who helped find 71 landmines and lots more types of UXO over a 5-year career. The ladmine hunting rats are called HeroRATs and they hae been helping demine countries since the 1990s.
              Each RescueRat has a backpack with a camera and battery, and also a GPS and altimeter. Every backpack has a button that the rats have been trained to press when they've found a victim.
